    One benefit of a thread pool over creating a new thread for each task is that thread creation and destruction overhead is 
    restricted to the initial creation of the pool, which may result in better performance and better system stability. 
    Creating and destroying a thread and its associated resources can be an expensive process in terms of time. 
    An excessive number of threads in reserve, however, wastes memory, and context-switching between the runnable threads invokes performance penalties. 
    A socket connection to another network host, which might take many CPU cycles to drop and re-establish, can be maintained more efficiently by associating it with a thread that lives over the course of more than one network transaction.`
